Objective:
In-memory data manager that can read, write, and modify data at the byte level.

Persistence:
.bin file

Complete data:
Struct of arrays, one array per data type.
All bytes initialized to 0.

For saving and reading:
Cast to char (1 byte)

Workflow:
When starting, ask the user which operation they want to perform:

Read
Write

Then, ask which data type they want to access:

int
char

If int is chosen, ask for which element and position at that element (multiples of 4) and display it.
If char is chosen, ask for which byte (position) and access it directly without multiples.

Add additional functions to cast the two arrays to the opposite type.
